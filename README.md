# EMS AlgaShop
This is a project built during the AlgaWorks Microservices Specialist Course (EMS) Level 2 - Domain-Driven Design.

It simulates an e-commerce application and has 2 microservices as submodules:

# ordering
Microservice built using a purist approach of DDD, separating the domain model from frameworks and any technological influences, in addition to the distinction between domain entities and persistence entities.

# billing
Microservice built using a pragmatic approach of DDD, accepting a certain dependence on frameworks and bringing the domain model closer to technological aspects, such as persistence, in order to reduce complexity and facilitate implementation.

# The technologies used are:
- Java 21 with Lombok
- Spring Boot with Spring Web and Spring Data JPA
- Docker
- Gradle
